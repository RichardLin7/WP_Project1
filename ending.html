        returns from his journey. The people were thrilled to hear that the dragon is
        no more. Thanks to Allard's heroic deeds, peace and prosperity returned to the
        Damarel. To commemorate, the king bestows Allard the title "The Onion Hero" and
        the kingdom passes down his tale for generations to come and cry about.</p>
